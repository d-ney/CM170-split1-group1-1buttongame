UNTITLED SKATEBOARD GAME (This readme is a living document, feel free to make changes!!)

GOAL: Create a one-button game about skateboard tricks (or maybe just one)

GAMEPLAY: An infinite runner (or skater). The player's goal is to go as far as possible without falling into a pit or screwing up a trick. Tap the button to jump in the air, then keep holding to rotate the board. Completing a rotation in the air results in 3 factors:
  1. The player gets a boost of score
  2. The player gets a score multiplier that increases with each successful trick in a row they complete
  3. The player gets a boost of "speed"

LOSE CONDITIONS:
If the player hits the ground while still rotating, then they fail the trick and (wipe out/lose their multiplier and then wipe out if they screw up again).
If the player falls into a pit, they wipe out.
If the player goes to slow and the back of the screen catches up to them, they wipe out.

DIFFICULTY:
As the game goes on, the screen will scroll faster and faster forcing the player to take more risks.
As well, the player's trick-performing speed will also increase, incentivizing them to play skillfully.
